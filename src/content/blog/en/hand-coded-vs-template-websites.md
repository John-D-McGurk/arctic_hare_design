When it comes to creating a website for your business, you have several options. The two most common choices are using website building platforms, such as WordPress or Wix, or opting for a custom, hand-coded website. Each option has its own set of benefits and drawbacks, but for many businesses, the advantages of a hand-coded website can make it the clear winner. In this article, we'll explore these advantages and delve into how each type of website functions under the hood.

## Understanding the Basics

### WordPress and Wix

WordPress is an open-source content management system (CMS) that allows users to build websites using pre-designed themes and plugins. It's customizable and has a vast community offering support and resources. Wix, on the other hand, is a website builder that provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, making it easy for anyone to create a website without any coding knowledge. Both platforms remove a great deal of the technical complexity, allowing users to focus on content.

### Hand-Coded Websites

A hand-coded website is built from the ground up using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other programming languages such as Python and SQL to manage the server-side. This method requires a deep understanding of web development, as every element of the site is crafted manually. This approach allows for complete control over the website's structure, design, and functionality and opens doors to websites that are far more customisable to work in line with the business’ needs.

## Advantages of Hand-Coded Websites

### 1. Performance and Speed

One of the most significant advantages of hand-coded websites is performance. Because they are built from scratch, developers can optimise every aspect of the code, ensuring that the website runs as efficiently as possible. Unlike WordPress or Wix, which may include unnecessary code or plugins that can slow down the site, hand-coded websites are lean and tailored to perform well. This results in faster load times, which can enhance user experience and improve search engine rankings. The difference in loading time can be as much as ten times when loading a static website (a website that doesn’t require code on a server)

### 2. Customization and Flexibility

Hand-coded websites offer unparalleled customization and flexibility. Since the developer has full control over the code, they can create any feature or functionality that the client desires. This level of customization is often challenging, or even impossible to achieve with WordPress or Wix, as users are limited to the capabilities of themes and plugins. Hand-coded websites can be tailored precisely to meet the specific needs and goals of the business, resulting in a unique and highly functional site.

### 3. Security

Security is a critical concern for any website. Hand-coded websites can be more secure than those built on WordPress or Wix because they are less likely to be targeted by hackers who exploit common vulnerabilities in popular platforms. By carefully writing and reviewing the code, developers can implement robust security measures and avoid many of the common risks associated with pre-built themes and plugins.

### 4. Search engine optimisation

Search engine optimisation, or SEO, is optimising a website to improve its visibility on search engines such as Google.  While WordPress and Wix offer SEO plugins and tools, a hand-coded website allows for more fine-toothed control over SEO optimization. Developers can make sure that the site follows best practices from the start, optimising everything from meta tags to URL structures. This level of control can in many cases lead to better search engine rankings and increased visibility for the business. In addition Google now uses the performance of the mobile site as part of the ranking algorithm, meaning that a fast mobile site is crucial to getting your site to the top of the Google rankings. See [19. Improved Mobile Optimization](#19-improved-mobile-optimization) for more in depth information.

### 5. No Dependency on Third-Party Platforms

With a hand-coded website, businesses are not tied to any third-party platform. This independence means that the website can be hosted anywhere. Moreover, businesses are not subject to the changes or limitations imposed by platforms like WordPress or Wix, providing greater stability and longevity for the site.


### 6. Unique Design

With a hand-coded website, the design possibilities are limitless. Unlike WordPress or Wix, where you might be constrained by the available themes and design options, a hand-coded website allows for a truly unique and bespoke design. This means your website can perfectly reflect your brand’s identity and stand out in a crowded online marketplace. Custom animations, interactive elements, and unique layouts can all be implemented to create a memorable user experience.

### 7. Enhanced User Experience

A hand-coded website can be optimised to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience. By focusing on clean, efficient code and streamlined design, developers can ensure that the site is user-friendly and easy to navigate. Custom-built features can enhance usability and accessibility, leading to higher user satisfaction and engagement. A positive user experience is critical for retaining visitors and converting them into customers.

### 8. Better Code Quality

Hand-coding a website allows developers to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code. This results in better maintainability and easier debugging. In contrast, websites built with platforms like WordPress or Wix often rely on third-party plugins and themes, which can introduce code bloat and inconsistencies, slowing down both website speed as well as debugging efforts. High-quality code is not only beneficial for current functionality but also makes future updates and maintenance more straightforward.


### 9. Ownership and Control

With a hand-coded website, you have complete ownership and control over your site's code and content. There are no restrictions imposed by third-party platforms, giving you the freedom to implement any changes or features as needed. This autonomy is particularly important for businesses that want to maintain control over their digital presence without being tied to the policies and limitations of platform providers.

### 10. Reduced Technical Debt

Technical debt refers to the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of a better approach that would take longer. Hand-coded websites typically have less technical debt because developers can implement the most efficient and sustainable solutions from the start. In contrast, websites built with WordPress or Wix might accumulate technical debt due to the use of numerous plugins, themes, and workarounds, which, at worst, have the potential to completely disable your website until a fix is found.


### 11. Efficient Resource Management

Hand-coded websites can be optimised for efficient resource management, ensuring that server resources such as CPU and memory are used effectively. This can lead to lower hosting costs and improved site performance, particularly under heavy traffic conditions. Unlike WordPress or Wix, where you might be paying for features and resources you don't need, a hand-coded website uses resources more efficiently and can be tailored to your specific requirements.

### 12. Faster Troubleshooting

When issues arise, troubleshooting a hand-coded website is often faster and more straightforward. Since the code is written and maintained by your development team, they can quickly identify and resolve issues without relying on external plugins or themes. This can significantly reduce downtime and ensure that your website remains operational and reliable.

### 13. Reduced Dependency on Third-Party Plugins

WordPress and Wix rely heavily on third-party plugins and themes to extend functionality, which can introduce compatibility issues, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks. With a hand-coded website, you can minimize or eliminate the need for third-party plugins, resulting in a more stable and secure website. Custom features can be built directly into the site, ensuring seamless integration and consistent performance.

### 14. Improved Data Privacy

Hand-coded websites can offer better data privacy and control. By not relying on third-party services and plugins, you reduce the risk of data breaches and ensure that sensitive information remains secure. You can implement your own data handling and storage practices, adhering to industry standards and compliance requirements.

### 15. Tailored User Analytics

While WordPress and Wix offer basic analytics through plugins, a hand-coded website allows for the implementation of advanced, tailored user analytics. Developers can integrate custom tracking solutions that provide deeper insights into user behaviour, helping you to make data-driven decisions and optimise your website for better performance and engagement.

### 16. Multi-Language Support

Hand-coded websites can be designed with multi-language support from the ground up. This allows for a more seamless and user-friendly experience for international visitors. While platforms like WordPress offer multi-language plugins, these can sometimes be cumbersome and less efficient than a custom-built solution. For our clients in non english speaking countries having the option to use multiple languages is almost a requirement these days.

### 17. Greater Compatibility with Legacy Systems

For businesses with existing legacy systems, a hand-coded website can be more easily integrated. Custom code can be written to ensure compatibility and smooth data exchange between the website and older systems, providing a cohesive and efficient workflow that might be difficult to achieve with pre-built platforms.


### 18. Unique Content Management Systems (CMS)

For businesses that require a CMS, a hand-coded website allows for the creation of a unique, tailored CMS that meets specific needs. This custom CMS can be more intuitive, user-friendly, and aligned with your business processes compared to generic solutions provided by WordPress or Wix.

### 19. Improved Mobile Optimization

While many WordPress and Wix themes claim to be mobile-friendly, a hand-coded website allows for true mobile optimization. Developers can ensure that every element is optimised for various screen sizes and devices, resulting in a superior mobile experience that can drive more traffic and engagement from mobile users, as well as improving your site’s visibility on Google.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right type of website for your business is a crucial decision. While WordPress and Wix offer convenience and ease of use, hand-coded websites stand out for their performance, customization, security, SEO optimization, and independence. By investing in a hand-coded website, businesses can achieve a unique, efficient, and secure online presence that can adapt and grow with their needs.
